		description: "Since Obsidian allows Google fonts, I've reintroduced all font weights for Spectral and Alegreya Sans. I've also expanded the weight slider from 200–800 to 200–900, so that Alegreya Sans users can use the **Black** 900 weight available."

		description: "Kepano has clarified that while Obsidian does ban network requests in themes, it makes an exception for requests from fonts.googleapis.com. Thus, Amiri is back in Obsidian, but requires an internet connection to work."

		title: "25 February 2024: Typomagical now works 100% offline"
		description: "Obsidian has required all theme developers to remove network requests from their themes. This is so Obsidian can be used 100% offline, and also for security reasons. To comply, Typomagical has removed some features. These include:

		- Amiri font for titles

		- Body text weight setting, only 400 and 700 will work


		If you dearly miss these, please contact me by filing a Github issue.
