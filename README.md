An Obsidian theme for typographic appreciators, with support for [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgmeyers

-----

## Features

- No tacky underlines - we achieve everything with  **bold**, *italic*, [small caps](https://practicaltypography.com/small-caps.html) and ***bold italic***
- Friendly text sizing
	- Responds correctly to the Text size slider in settings to Pinch-to-zoom, and to the Ctrl+ shortcut!
	- Mobile friendly headings - it resizes to small and large screens!
	- For even more, install the Style Settings plugin to tweak the type scaling
- Light/Dark support
- High Contrast mode available for increased accessibility. Install the Style Settings plugin to enable it!
- Bonus themes - By installing the Style Settings plugin, you can choose additional colour schemes including Ficus Ruby and VilePlume!
- Hand crafted CSS - no `!important`, and minimal class use for easy overriding if you like using your own CSS snippets.
- Ligature toggle. Like ligatures? You'll like this theme! Don't like ligatures? Install Style Settings and you can turn them off.
