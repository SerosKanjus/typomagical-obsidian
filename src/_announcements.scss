		description: "Obsidian has required all theme developers to remove network requests from their themes. This is so Obsidian can be used 100% offline, and also for security reasons. To comply, Typomagical has removed some features. These include:

		- Amiri font for titles

		- Body text weight setting, only 400 and 700 will work


		If you dearly miss these, please contact me by filing a Github issue.
